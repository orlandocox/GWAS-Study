# GWAS-Study
A useful guide of what GWAS is and code that is explained and can be utilised to help fellow users

Welcome, I have recently completed a Post-GWAS analysis of GWAS data studying Force Vital Capacity, I found throughout my studies there to be a vast chasm of knowledge lacking in the public information and suggestions towards how to conduct GWAS, especially towards the novices and inexperienced. This document and the associated coding will act as a template for anyone to use, be it directly or as a form of inspiration. In this document, I have provided code and attempted to explain why I used each line and the function it is attempting to complete. While the code acts as a guide, it must be stated that each GWAS study is different, be it in what is being tested, the sample or the outcome the researcher wishes to accomplish. I should also state that I wish this guide to be collaborative, and encourage anyone to add any information, code or guides within the project, aiming to make Bioinformatics more accessible and helpful to all. As I'm sure we all know, the largest limiting factor of GWAS studies is the sample size, and making it more accessible is a key and grassroots solution to the limitation.
