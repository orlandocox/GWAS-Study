# Introduction to Post-GWAS analysis
## 1. What is GWAS?


Genome-Wide Association Studies (**GWAS**) are a powerful tool used to identify associations between genetic variants and traits or diseases. These studies analyze the genomes of large populations to pinpoint Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (**SNPs**) that are statistically linked to specific traits. GWAS has revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of complex diseases and traits, paving the way for breakthroughs in personalized medicine and therapeutic development.

### **What You Need to Know About GWAS**


#### **1.1 Key Concepts**
- **Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs):**
  - SNPs are single base-pair changes in the DNA sequence that occur commonly in the population.
  - They serve as markers for locating genes associated with diseases or traits.
- **Polygenic Traits:**
  - Many traits (e.g., height, diabetes susceptibility) are influenced by multiple genes, making GWAS essential for understanding their genetic architecture.
- **Statistical Significance:**
  - GWAS identifies SNPs that have a statistically significant association with a trait, usually using a p-value threshold of **5 × 10⁻⁸**.


#### **1.2 How GWAS Works**
1. **Sample Collection:**
   - DNA samples are collected from a large number of individuals, typically divided into two groups:
     - **Case Group:** Individuals with the trait or disease.
     - **Control Group:** Individuals without the trait or disease.
2. **Genotyping:**
   - The genomes of participants are analyzed for millions of SNPs using genotyping arrays or sequencing technologies.
3. **Association Analysis:**
   - Statistical methods (e.g., logistic regression) compare allele frequencies of SNPs between the case and control groups.
   - Significant associations indicate a potential genetic contribution to the trait.
4. **Visualization:**
   - Results are often presented as **Manhattan plots**, where each SNP’s significance is plotted against its genomic position.


#### **1.3 Strengths of GWAS**
- **High Resolution:** Identifies SNPs associated with traits across the entire genome.
- **Hypothesis-Free:** Does not require prior assumptions about which genes are involved.
- **Broad Applications:** Useful for studying a wide range of traits, from diseases to behavioral characteristics.


#### **1.4 Limitations of GWAS**
- **Correlation, Not Causation:**
  - GWAS identifies associations, but not whether a SNP directly causes a trait.
- **Missing Heritability:**
  - GWAS explains only a fraction of the genetic basis for many traits due to small effect sizes and untested variants.
- **Population Bias:**
  - Many studies are conducted in European populations, limiting applicability to other groups.
