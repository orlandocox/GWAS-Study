## 5. Colocalization Analysis

After identifying SNPs associated with a trait and performing **gene set enrichment analysis**, the next step is to determine whether these SNPs are **causally linked to gene expression**. **Colocalization analysis** helps establish whether a **GWAS signal and an expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) signal** share the same causal variant.

By performing **colocalization**, we can distinguish between:
- **True causal variants** that influence both gene expression and disease.
- **Independent signals** where a SNP is associated with a trait but not gene expression.
- **False positives** due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) or spurious associations.

### **5.1 Purpose of Colocalization: Linking Variants to Causal Genes**
**Colocalization analysis** tests whether a **GWAS-identified SNP** is also responsible for **variations in gene expression (eQTLs).** If a SNP affects both disease risk and gene expression, it is **more likely to be functionally relevant**.

#### **Key Questions Answered by Colocalization:**
- Is the **same SNP responsible** for both a trait and changes in gene expression?
- Can we prioritize **causal genes** instead of nearby associated genes?
- Does this variant have a known **biological function** or therapeutic relevance?

#### **Example: Why Colocalization Matters**
A GWAS identifies **rs62164511** as associated with **Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)**.  
- If **rs62164511** also affects expression of the **EFEMP1** gene in lung tissue (**eQTL signal**), this suggests that **EFEMP1 may be involved in lung function decline**.
- If **rs62164511** does **not** show an eQTL effect, the association may be **indirect or due to LD**.

Colocalization helps determine if **rs62164511** is truly a **causal variant** influencing both **lung function and EFEMP1 expression**.

### **5.2 Tools for Colocalization: Introduction to the `coloc` R Package**
The **`coloc` R package** is one of the most widely used tools for colocalization analysis. It performs a **Bayesian test** to assess whether two association signals (e.g., GWAS and eQTL) share a common causal variant.

#### **Key Features of `coloc`:**
- Compares **GWAS summary statistics** and **eQTL data**.
- Uses **Bayesian statistical models** to estimate colocalization probability.
- Outputs **posterior probabilities** for different causal scenarios.

#### **Example Workflow Using `coloc` in R**
**Step 1: Load Required Libraries**
```r
library(coloc)
```

**Step 2: Load GWAS and eQTL Data**
```r
gwas_data <- read.table("gwas_summary.txt", header=TRUE)
eqtl_data <- read.table("eqtl_summary.txt", header=TRUE)
```

**Step 3: Format the Data for `coloc`**
```r
gwas_list <- list(beta = gwas_data$BETA, varbeta = gwas_data$SE^2, 
                  snp = gwas_data$SNP, N = gwas_data$N, type = "quant")

eqtl_list <- list(beta = eqtl_data$BETA, varbeta = eqtl_data$SE^2, 
                  snp = eqtl_data$SNP, N = eqtl_data$N, type = "quant")
```

**Step 4: Run Colocalization Analysis**
```r
coloc_results <- coloc.abf(dataset1 = gwas_list, dataset2 = eqtl_list)
```

**Step 5: View Results**
```r
print(coloc_results$summary)
```

### **5.3 Interpreting Colocalization Results: Bayesian Posterior Probabilities**
The `coloc` package outputs **posterior probabilities (PP)** for different **causal hypotheses**:

| **Hypothesis** | **Interpretation** | **Posterior Probability (PP)** |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **H0** | No association with either trait. | `PP.H0` |
| **H1** | SNP is associated with **GWAS only**. | `PP.H1` |
| **H2** | SNP is associated with **eQTL only**. | `PP.H2` |
| **H3** | SNPs are associated with **both traits but independently**. | `PP.H3` |
| **H4** | **Colocalization: SNP drives both traits**. | `PP.H4` |

#### **Example Interpretation:**
If `PP.H4 = 0.85`, this means there is **an 85% probability that the same SNP influences both gene expression and disease risk**. This strongly suggests **causality**.

#### **Thresholds for Colocalization:**
- **PP.H4 > 0.8** → Strong colocalization (likely causal SNP).
- **PP.H4 between 0.5 - 0.8** → Moderate evidence.
- **PP.H4 < 0.5** → Weak or no colocalization.

### **5.4 Example: Colocalization in Lung Function**
A researcher wants to test if **rs3795503**, identified in a **GWAS for lung function**, also regulates expression of the **KIAA1614** gene in lung tissue.

#### **Colocalization Results:**
```r
$summary
  PP.H0 = 0.05  # Low probability of no association
  PP.H1 = 0.02  # Weak evidence for GWAS-only association
  PP.H2 = 0.03  # Weak evidence for eQTL-only association
  PP.H3 = 0.05  # Weak evidence for independent associations
  PP.H4 = 0.85  # Strong evidence for shared causal variant
```
#### **Interpretation:**
- **85% probability that rs3795503 is the causal SNP for both lung function and KIAA1614 expression**.
- This suggests **KIAA1614 plays a role in lung function**, making it a **strong candidate for further study**.

### **5.5 Summary of Colocalization Analysis**
| **Step** | **Purpose** |
|---------|------------|
| **Obtain GWAS & eQTL summary statistics** | Input data for colocalization testing. |
| **Run `coloc` analysis** | Bayesian method to test shared causality. |
| **Interpret posterior probabilities** | Identify whether the SNP is truly causal. |

### **5.6 What We Will Cover Next**
Now that we have **identified causal SNPs using colocalization**, the next sections will explore:
1. **Integration with external databases (e.g., Open Targets, GWAS Catalog) to validate variant-disease associations.**
2. **Prioritization of SNPs for functional validation and experimental follow-up.**
3. **Using colocalization insights for therapeutic target discovery.**

By the end of this guide, you will be able to **link GWAS findings to causal genes with confidence and prioritize variants for further research**.
