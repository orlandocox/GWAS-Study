## 6. Integration of External Databases

Once we have performed **variant annotation, gene set enrichment, and colocalization analysis**, the next step is to **validate and contextualize our findings** using **external databases**.  

These databases provide **curated genetic associations, functional annotations, and protein interactions**, helping us:
- Determine if a **SNP has been previously associated** with a trait.
- Identify **biological pathways and gene functions** linked to GWAS hits.
- Prioritize **variants for further study and potential therapeutic targeting**.

---

### **6.1 Key Databases for Post-GWAS Analysis**
Several well-established databases can be used to **validate and contextualize GWAS results**:

#### **1. GWAS Catalog**
- A **comprehensive repository** of published GWAS findings.
- Contains associations between **genetic variants and diseases/traits**.
- Helps determine if a SNP has been **previously reported** in another study.

**How to Use:**
- **Manual search:** Visit [GWAS Catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) and search for a SNP or gene.
- **Programmatic access:** Query using **R or Python**.

**Example query in R:**
```r
library(gwasrapidd)
results <- get_variants(variant_id = "rs62164511")
print(results)
```

---

#### **2. Open Targets**
- A database linking **genetics, genomics, and drug discovery**.
- Provides insights into **gene-disease associations** and **potential drug targets**.
- Integrates data from **GWAS, expression studies, and clinical trials**.

**How to Use:**
- **Manual search:** Visit [Open Targets](https://platform.opentargets.org/) and enter a **gene or disease**.
- **API query:** Retrieve data for large-scale analyses.

**Example query in Python:**
```python
import requests
response = requests.get("https://api.platform.opentargets.org/v3/platform/public/evidence/filter?target=ENSG00000139618")
print(response.json())
```

#### **3. STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins)**
- A database of **protein-protein interactions (PPIs)**.
- Helps identify **functional interactions between genes and pathways**.
- Useful for understanding how GWAS-associated genes interact in a **biological network**.

**How to Use:**
- **Web interface:** Visit [STRING](https://string-db.org/) and search for a **gene of interest**.
- **Batch analysis:** Upload a list of genes to identify **network connections**.

**Example STRING output:**
| **Gene** | **Interacting Partners** | **Interaction Score** |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **IL6R** | STAT3, JAK1, SOCS3 | 0.92 |
| **MAP3K1** | MAPK8, RAF1, JUN | 0.87 |
| **SERPINA1** | ELANE, CTSG, MMP9 | 0.81 |

### **6.2 How to Validate and Contextualize GWAS Results**
After retrieving data from external databases, we need to determine whether our **GWAS-identified SNPs and genes are novel or previously reported**.

#### **Step 1: Identifying Novel vs. Previously Associated SNPs**
- **Check the GWAS Catalog** for previously reported SNPs.
- Compare **effect sizes and p-values** with published results.
- Determine if the SNP has **consistent associations across studies**.

**Example: GWAS Catalog Search for rs3795503**
| **Study** | **Trait** | **p-value** | **Effect Size** |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Smith et al. (2022) | Lung Function (FVC) | `4.1e-7` | `-0.24` |
| Current Study | Lung Function (FVC) | `3.2e-8` | `-0.25` |

**Interpretation:**  
- **rs3795503 has been previously reported** in lung function studies, reinforcing its relevance.
- The **effect size is similar**, suggesting a **replicable association**.

---

#### **Step 2: Cross-Referencing with Known Data**
Once SNPs and genes are identified, they should be **cross-referenced** with functional and drug discovery databases.

- **Use Open Targets** to determine **therapeutic relevance**.
- **Use STRING** to find **gene-protein interactions**.
- **Use Reactome/KEGG** to identify **pathways linked to disease mechanisms**.

**Example: Using Open Targets to Find Drug Candidates**
```python
import requests
response = requests.get("https://api.platform.opentargets.org/v3/platform/public/association/filter?disease=EFO_0000305")
print(response.json())
```

### **6.3 Summary of External Database Integration**
| **Database** | **Purpose** | **How It Helps** |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| **GWAS Catalog** | Validates if SNPs were previously associated with a trait. | Confirms replication of findings. |
| **Open Targets** | Links genes to diseases and drug targets. | Helps prioritize therapeutic candidates. |
| **STRING** | Identifies protein-protein interactions. | Determines functional relationships between genes. |

### **6.4 What We Will Cover Next**
Now that we have **validated GWAS results using external databases**, the next sections will explore:
1. **Prioritization of SNPs for experimental validation.**
2. **Drug repurposing strategies based on GWAS findings.**
3. **Translating genetic insights into clinical applications.**

By the end of this guide, you will be able to **integrate GWAS results with external resources for a deeper biological and therapeutic understanding**.
