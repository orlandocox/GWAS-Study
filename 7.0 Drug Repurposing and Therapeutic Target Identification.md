## 7. Drug Repurposing and Therapeutic Target Identification

One of the most exciting applications of GWAS findings is **drug repurposing**â€”identifying **existing drugs** that may be effective for new indications based on genetic associations.  
By linking GWAS-identified genes to **drug targets**, we can:
- **Accelerate drug discovery** by identifying approved drugs with potential new uses.
- **Prioritize therapeutic targets** based on genetic evidence.
- **Reduce costs and risks** by leveraging existing safety data for approved drugs.

This section explores **how to identify druggable genes**, highlights a **case study**, and provides **tools for evaluating drug-gene interactions**.

### **7.1 Identifying Druggable Genes**
Not all genes identified in GWAS are **suitable drug targets**.  
A **druggable gene** is one that:
- Encodes a protein that **can be targeted by a small molecule or biologic**.
- Has a **known role in disease mechanisms**.
- Shows **strong genetic evidence for association with the trait**.

To find druggable genes, we use resources like the **Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb)**.

#### **Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb)**
- DGIdb is a **comprehensive database** linking **genes to known drugs and drug-like compounds**.
- Helps determine whether a **GWAS-prioritized gene has existing drug interactions**.

**How to Use DGIdb:**
- **Web search:** Visit [DGIdb](https://www.dgidb.org/) and search for a **gene of interest**.
- **API query:** Automate searches for multiple genes.

**Example API Query in Python:**
```python
import requests
response = requests.get("https://dgidb.org/api/v2/interactions.json?genes=MAP3K1")
print(response.json())
```

**Example DGIdb Output for MAP3K1:**
| **Gene** | **Drug** | **Interaction Type** | **Drug Status** |
|---------|---------|------------------|--------------|
| **MAP3K1** | E-6201 | Inhibitor | Investigational |
| **MAP3K1** | Trametinib | MEK Inhibitor | Approved |
| **MAP3K1** | Selumetinib | MEK Inhibitor | Approved |

This table shows that **MAP3K1** is **targetable by multiple drugs**, making it a promising **therapeutic target**.

### **7.2 Examples of Drug Repurposing**
By integrating **GWAS findings with drug databases**, we can identify drugs that **may be repurposed for new indications**.

#### **Case Study: E-6201 for MAP3K1**
- **MAP3K1** is a **kinase** implicated in **lung disease and fibrosis**.
- The **GWAS Catalog** and **colocalization analysis** suggest that MAP3K1 variants influence **lung function (FVC)**.
- **E-6201**, a **MEK1/2 inhibitor**, was originally developed for **cancer treatment** but may have **anti-fibrotic effects**.

**Supporting Evidence for Drug Repurposing:**
| **Data Source** | **Finding** |
|---------------|------------|
| **GWAS** | MAP3K1 associated with lung function. |
| **eQTL Analysis** | MAP3K1 expression linked to inflammation. |
| **DGIdb** | E-6201 inhibits MAP3K1. |
| **ClinicalTrials.gov** | E-6201 tested in cancer trials, may be repurposed for lung fibrosis. |

#### **Potential Application:**
- **Hypothesis:** If MAP3K1 contributes to **lung fibrosis**, E-6201 could be repurposed as a **therapeutic intervention**.
- **Next Steps:** Functional validation in **preclinical models and clinical trials**.

### **7.3 How to Evaluate Drug-Gene Interactions**
To determine whether a drug-target interaction is promising, we need to consider:

#### **1. Genetic Evidence**
- **Does the target gene have a strong GWAS association?**
- **Has colocalization analysis confirmed its causal role?**
- **Are there eQTLs linking the gene to disease pathways?**

#### **2. Drugability & Mechanism of Action**
- **Does the gene encode a protein that can be targeted?**
- **Are there existing drugs that modulate this protein?**
- **Is the drug an agonist or antagonist?**

#### **3. Clinical & Safety Data**
- **Has the drug been tested in humans?**
- **Are there known side effects or safety concerns?**
- **Has the drug been approved for another indication?**

### **7.4 Tools for Evaluating Drug-Gene Interactions**
Several bioinformatics resources can help assess **the potential of drug-target interactions**.

| **Tool** | **Purpose** | **How to Use** |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **DGIdb** | Identifies **known drug-gene interactions**. | Search for genes on [DGIdb](https://www.dgidb.org/). |
| **Open Targets** | Provides **gene-disease-drug associations**. | Search for genes on [Open Targets](https://platform.opentargets.org/). |
| **DrugBank** | Contains **detailed drug mechanism data**. | Search for drugs on [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com/). |
| **ChEMBL** | Provides **compound bioactivity data**. | Search for small molecules on [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/). |
| **ClinicalTrials.gov** | Finds **clinical trials for repurposing opportunities**. | Search for drug trials on [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/). |

### **7.5 Summary of Drug Repurposing Analysis**
| **Step** | **Purpose** |
|---------|------------|
| **Identify druggable genes** | Use DGIdb and Open Targets to find targetable GWAS genes. |
| **Cross-reference with known drugs** | Check DrugBank and ChEMBL for existing compounds. |
| **Assess mechanism and safety** | Evaluate drug-target interactions and clinical history. |
| **Prioritize candidates for trials** | Select the best candidates for experimental validation. |
