# 3. Variant Annotation

Once high-quality variants have been filtered, the next step in post-GWAS analysis is **variant annotation**. This process provides **biological context** to SNPs by determining their location, functional impact, and potential role in disease.

Variant annotation is crucial for **prioritizing SNPs for further analysis**, helping researchers differentiate between **associative** and **causative** variants.

### **3.1 What is Variant Annotation?**
**Variant annotation** is the process of assigning **biological meaning** to genetic variants by integrating them with **functional, regulatory, and disease-related data**.  

It helps answer key questions:
- **Where is the SNP located?** (coding region, intron, promoter, enhancer, etc.)
- **Does the SNP alter protein structure or function?**
- **Is the SNP associated with a known disease or trait?**
- **How common is the SNP in the population?** (Minor Allele Frequency, MAF)

#### **Types of Variant Annotations**
| **Annotation Type** | **Description** | **Example** |
|---------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Genomic Location** | Determines if the SNP is in a **coding, non-coding, or regulatory region**. | Exonic, intronic, UTR, intergenic |
| **Functional Impact** | Predicts how the SNP affects **gene expression or protein function**. | Missense, nonsense, synonymous |
| **Regulatory Potential** | Assesses if the SNP affects **promoters, enhancers, or splicing sites**. | eQTLs, TF binding sites |
| **Disease Association** | Links SNPs to known **disease-related genes**. | GWAS Catalog, ClinVar |
| **Conservation Score** | Measures evolutionary conservation to infer functional importance. | PhyloP, GERP++ |

### **3.2 Tools for Variant Annotation**
Several bioinformatics tools integrate **public databases** to annotate SNPs with functional and regulatory data. Below are some commonly used tools:

#### **1. ANNOVAR (Annotation of Genetic Variants)**
- One of the most widely used tools for **variant annotation and filtering**.
- Can assign **gene-based, region-based, and filter-based annotations**.
- Supports **multiple genome builds (hg19, hg38)**.

**Example command:**
```bash
table_annovar.pl input.vcf humandb/ -buildver hg19 -out output -remove -protocol refGene,dbnsfp35a -operation g,f
