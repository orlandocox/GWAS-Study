## 4. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

Once we have identified and annotated significant SNPs from a GWAS, the next step is to determine their **biological significance**. This is where **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)** comes in. GSEA helps us understand whether the identified genetic variants are enriched in specific **biological pathways, molecular functions, or disease processes**.

By performing **pathway and disease enrichment analysis**, we can link genetic associations to **functional mechanisms** and **identify potential therapeutic targets**.

### **4.1 What is Gene Set Enrichment?**
**Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)** is a computational method that determines whether a set of genes **(e.g., genes near GWAS hits)** is **overrepresented** in a predefined biological pathway or functional category.

Instead of analyzing individual genes in isolation, GSEA assesses whether **multiple genes associated with a trait** are **enriched** in specific pathways, helping to reveal the underlying **biological mechanisms**.

**Key Questions Answered by GSEA:**
- Do the genes associated with a trait belong to specific biological pathways?
- Are these genes involved in known disease mechanisms?
- Can these findings help prioritize potential therapeutic targets?

### **4.2 Pathway and Disease Enrichment Analysis**
There are several widely used databases and tools for **gene set and pathway enrichment**. These tools compare GWAS-associated genes to **curated biological pathways and disease annotations**.

#### **1. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)**
- KEGG is a **comprehensive database of biological pathways**.
- It categorizes genes into **metabolic, signaling, and disease pathways**.
- Helps determine whether GWAS hits **map to specific disease-related pathways**.

**Example KEGG Pathways:**
- **hsa05200**: Pathways in cancer
- **hsa05010**: Alzheimer's disease pathway
- **hsa04610**: Complement and coagulation cascades

#### **2. Reactome**
- A detailed database of **human biological pathways**.
- Provides **hierarchical pathway analysis** from broad to specific biological processes.
- Helps in understanding **functional relationships between genes**.

**Example Reactome Pathways:**
- **R-HSA-168256**: Immune system activation
- **R-HSA-447041**: MAP kinase signaling pathway
- **R-HSA-1430728**: Extracellular matrix organization

#### **3. Enrichr**
- A fast and user-friendly tool for **gene set enrichment analysis**.
- Integrates multiple pathway databases, including **KEGG, Reactome, BioPlanet, and WikiPathways**.
- Also provides disease enrichment using **GWAS Catalog, OMIM, and ClinVar**.

**Example Enrichr Output:**
| **Pathway** | **Adjusted p-value** | **Odds Ratio** |
|------------|----------------------|---------------|
| KEGG: Insulin signaling | `3.2e-5` | `2.8` |
| Reactome: MAPK cascade | `6.5e-4` | `2.1` |
| GWAS Catalog: Asthma | `2.1e-3` | `1.9` |

### **4.3 Interpreting Enrichment Results**
After running pathway and disease enrichment analysis, the results need to be **interpreted in a biological context**.

#### **Key Metrics to Consider:**
- **p-value / Adjusted p-value**: Measures statistical significance (adjusted for multiple comparisons).
- **Odds Ratio (OR)**: Indicates **how much more likely** the gene set is enriched in a pathway.
- **Gene Count**: Number of genes from the input list found in the pathway.

#### **Example Interpretation:**
A GWAS for **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** identifies SNPs in genes **MAP3K1, IL6R, and SERPINA1**. Enrichment analysis shows:
- **KEGG: Cytokine signaling pathway (p = 2.4e-6, OR = 3.2)**  
  → Suggests an inflammatory response mechanism.
- **Reactome: Collagen biosynthesis (p = 7.1e-4, OR = 2.5)**  
  → Indicates potential lung tissue remodeling.
- **GWAS Catalog: Asthma-related genes (p = 1.2e-3, OR = 2.0)**  
  → Supports genetic overlap between COPD and asthma.

These findings help **narrow down candidate genes** for functional validation and potential **therapeutic targeting**.

### **4.6 What We Will Cover Next**
Now that we have **identified enriched pathways and biological functions**, the next sections will explore:
1. **Colocalization analysis to confirm whether SNPs affect both gene expression and disease risk.**
2. **Integration with external databases (e.g., Open Targets, GWAS Catalog) to validate variant-disease associations.**
3. **Using enrichment results for drug repurposing and therapeutic targeting.**

By the end of this guide, you will be able to **link GWAS findings to functional pathways and prioritize genes for further study**.
